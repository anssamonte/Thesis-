PHA1 is characterized by urinary salt wasting, resulting from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal dominant form that is mild, and the recessive form which is more severe and due to defects in any of the epithelial sodium channel subunits. In autosomal dominant PHA1 the target organ defect is confined to kidney. Clinical expression can vary from asymptomatic to moderate. It may be severe at birth, but symptoms remit with age. Familial and sporadic cases have been reported.;Defects in NR3C2 are a cause of early onset hypertension with severe exacerbation in pregnancy [MIM:605115]. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. The disease is characterized by the onset of severe hypertension before the age of 20, and by suppression of aldosterone secretion."

Two receptors bind one interferon gamma dimer.,"Defects in IFNGR1 are a cause of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) [MIM:209950]; also known as familial disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection. This rare condition confers predisposition to illness caused by moderately virulent mycobacterial species, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and by the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. The pathogenic mechanism underlying MSMD is the impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity whose severity determines the clinical outcome. Some patients die of overwhelming mycobacterial disease with lepromatous-like lesions in early childhood, whereas others develop, later in life, disseminated but curable infections with tuberculoid granulomas. MSMD is a genetically heterogeneous disease with autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked inheritance."

Promotes rapid degradation of CTNNB1 and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC activity is correlated with its phosphorylation state.,"Defects in APC are a cause of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) [MIM:175100]; which includes also Gardner syndrome (GS). FAP and GS contribute to tumor development in patients with uninherited forms of colorectal cancer. FAP is characterized by adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum, but also of upper gastrointestinal tract (ampullary, duodenal and gastric adenomas). This is a viciously premalignant disease with one or more polyps progressing through dysplasia to malignancy in untreated gene carriers with a median age at diagnosis of 40 years.;APC mutations have led to some interesting observations. (1) the great majority of the mutations found to date would result in truncation of the APC product. (2) almost all the mutations have occurred within the first half of the coding sequence, and somatic mutations in colorectal tumors are further clustered in a particular region, called MCR (mutation cluster region). (3) most identified point mutations in the APC gene are transitions from cytosine to other nucleotides. (4) the location of germline mutations tends to correlate with the number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients. Inactivation of both alleles of the APC gene seems to be required as an early event to develop most adenomas and carcinomas in the colon and rectum as well as some of those in the stomach.;Defects in APC are a cause of hereditary desmoid disease (HDD) [MIM:135290]; also called familial infiltrative fibromatosis (FIF). It is an autosomal dominant trait with 100% penetrance and possible variable expression among affected relatives. HDD patients show multifocal fibromatosis of the paraspinal muscles, breast, occiput, arms, lower ribs, abdominal wall, and mesentery. Desmoid tumors appears also as a complication of familial adenomatous polyposis.;Defects in APC are a cause of medulloblastoma (MDB) [MIM:155255]. MDB is a malignant, invasive embryonal tumor of the cerebellum with a preferential manifestation in children. Although the majority of medulloblastomas occur sporadically, some manifest within familial cancer syndromes such as Turcot syndrome and basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome).;Defects in APC are a cause of Turcot syndrome [MIM:276300]. Turcot syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malignant tumors of the brain associated with multiple colorectal adenomas.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex, multifactorial disorder that typically manifests after the age of 50 years, although early-onset cases (before 50 years) are known. PD generally arises as a sporadic condition but is occasionally inherited as a simple mendelian trait. Although sporadic and familial PD are very similar, inherited forms of the disease usually begin at earlier ages and are associated with atypical clinical features. PD is characterized by bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscular rigidity and postural instability, as well as by a clinically significant response to treatment with levodopa. The pathology involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies (intraneuronal accumulations of aggregated proteins), in surviving neurons in various areas of the brain."

This is a form of non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of Dacie type 1. After splenectomy, which has little benefit, basophilic inclusions called Heinz bodies are demonstrable in the erythrocytes. Before splenectomy, diffuse or punctate basophilia may be evident. Most of these cases are probably instances of hemoglobinopathy. The hemoglobin demonstrates heat lability. Heinz bodies are observed also with the Ivemark syndrome (asplenia with cardiovascular anomalies) and with glutathione peroxidase deficiency.;Defects in HBA1/HBA2 are the cause of alpha-thalassemia [MIM:141800, 604131]. The thalassemias are the most common monogenic diseases and occur mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of alpha-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. The level of alpha chain production can range from none to very nearly normal levels. Deletion of both copies of each of the two alpha-globin genes causes alpha(0)-thalassemia, also known as homozygous alpha thalassemia. Due to the complete absence of alpha chains, the predominant fetal hemoglobin is a tetramer of gamma- chains (Bart hemoglobin) that has essentially no oxygen carrying capacity. This causes oxygen starvation in the fetal tissues leading to prenatal lethality or early neonatal death. The loss of three alpha genes results in high levels of a tetramer of four beta chains (hemoglobin H), causing a severe and life-threatening anemia known as hemoglobin H disease. Untreated, most patients die in childhood or early adolescence. The loss of two alpha genes results in mild alpha-thalassemia, also known as heterozygous alpha-thalassemia. Affected individuals have small red cells and a mild anemia (microcytosis). If three of the four alpha-globin genes are functional, individuals are completely asymptomatic. Some rare forms of alpha-thalassemia are due to point mutations (non-deletional alpha-thalassemia). The thalassemic phenotype is due to unstable globin alpha chains that are rapidly catabolized prior to formation of the alpha-beta heterotetramers.;Alpha(0)-thalassemia is associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis [MIM:236750]. Hydrops fetalis is a generalized edema of the fetus with fluid accumulation in the body cavities."

Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).",NONE

Acts in concert with pancreatic lipase and colipase for the complete digestion of dietary triglycerides.,"Defects in CEL are a cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 8 with exocrine dysfunction (MODY8) [MIM:609812]; also known as diabetes and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction (DPED). MODY [MIM:606391] is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes mellitus. The pancreas serves both endocrine and exocrine functions. The endocrine cells are found in the islets of Langerhans. They synthesize insulin and other hormones, and are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The exocrine cells produce bicarbonate and digestive enzymes and are involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic malabsorption. The localization of the islets within exocrine pancreatic tissue is suggestive of an interdependency and cross-talk between these two cell populations in their normal and in their abnormal function."

Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates involved in this process. When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extra-cellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell and result in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN). Also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and at gap junctions. Implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA-processing. Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus.",NONE
