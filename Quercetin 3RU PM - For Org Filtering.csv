The effect of MC is to increase ion and water tr,"Defects in NR3C2 are a cause of autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1) [MIM:177735]. PHA1 is characterized by urinary salt wasting, resulting from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal dominant form that is mild, and the recessive form which is more severe and due to defects in any of the epithelial sodium channel subunits. In autosomal dominant PHA1 the target organ defect is confined to kidney. Clinical expression can vary from asymptomatic to moderate. It may be severe at birth, but symptoms remit with age. Familial and sporadic cases have been reported.;Defects in NR3C2 are a cause of early onset hypertension with severe exacerbation in pregnancy [MIM:605115]. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. The disease is characterized by the onset of severe hypertension before the age of 20, and by suppression of aldosterone secretion.","Metabolic disorder;Hypertension;Cardiovascular disease;Urinary tract disease

Transcription factor activity is modulated by bound coactivator and core,"Genetic variation in AR can be responsible of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) [MIM:109200].;Defects in AR are the cause of androgen insensibility syndrome (AIS) [MIM:300068]; previously known as testicular feminization syndrome (TFM). It can be complete (CAIS) when external genitalia are phenotypically female; or partial (PAIS) when external genitalia are substantively ambiguous or mild (MAIS) when external genitalia are normal male or nearly so.;Defects in AR are the cause of X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) [MIM:313200]; also known as Kennedy disease. In SBMA patients the number of Gln ranges from 40 to 52. Longer expansions result in earlier onset and more severe clinical manifestations of the disease.;Defects in AR may play a role in metastatic prostate cancer. The mutated receptor stimulates prostate growth and metastases development despite of androgen ablation. This treatment can reduce primary and metastatic lesions probably by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells when they express the wild-type receptor.;Defects in AR may be the cause of infertility male syndrome [MIM:308370]; also called androgen insensitivity. It is characterized by azoospermia, elevated testosterone and luteinizing hormone plasma levels and an abnormal androgen receptor.;Defects in AR are the cause of Reifenstein syndrome [MIM:312300]; also known as partial androgen insensitivity. The features of this form of male pseudohermaphroditism are hypospadias, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, normal XY karyotype, and a pedigree pattern consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance.","Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;Hepatitis B virus infection;Cardiac failure;Andrology;Hirsutism;Female sexual dysfunction;Psoriasis;Reperfusion injury;Plasmodium infection;Atherosclerosis;Prostate hyperplasia;Fatigue;Male sexual dysfunction;Autoimmune disease;Testosterone deficiency;Uterine fibroids;Metabolic disorder;Myalgia;Obesity;Gynecological disorder;Contraception;Cancer;Hypercholesterolemia;Skin burns;Seborrhea;Growth disorder;Bone tumor;Muscular dystrophy;Erectile dysfunction;Systemic lupus erythematosus;Asthma;Wound healing;Cerebrovascular ischemia;Acne;Hypogonadism;HIV infection;Neoplasm;Dermatological disease;Prostate disease;Multiple sclerosis;Lacrimal gland disease;Alopecia;Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection;Ovary cyst;Carcinoma;Cardiovascular disease;Cachexia;Muscle wasting disease;Cervical dystonia;Anemia;Endocrine disease;Non-insulin dependent diabetes;Breast tumor;Female contraception;Fungal infection;Cystic fibrosis;Prostate tumor;Estrogen deficiency;Endometriosis;Hormone deficiency;Turners syndrome;Keratosis;Premenstrual syndrome;Hepatitis C virus infection;Benign tumor;Osteoporosis;Male contraception

It is a severe insulin resistance syndrome characterized by insulin- resistant diabetes mellitus with pineal hyperplasia and somatic abnormalities. Typical features include coarse, senile-appearing facies, dental and skin abnormalities, abdominal distension, and phallic enlargement. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.;Defects in INSR are the cause of leprechaunism [MIM:246200]; also known as Donohue syndrome. Leprechaunism represents the most severe form of insulin resistance syndrome, characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation and death in early infancy. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.;Defects in INSR may be associated with noninsulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) [MIM:125853]; also known as diabetes mellitus type 2.;Defects in INSR are the cause of familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia 5 (HHF5) [MIM:609968]. Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [MIM:256450], also referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism, nesidioblastosis, or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PPHI), is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and is due to defective negative feedback regulation of insulin secretion by low glucose levels.;Defects in INSR are the cause of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with acanthosis nigricans type A (IRAN type A) [MIM:610549]. This syndrome is characterized by the association of severe insulin resistance (manifested by marked hyperinsulinemia and a failure to respond to exogenous insulin) with the skin lesion acanthosis nigricans and ovarian hyperandrogenism in adolescent female subjects. Women frequently present with hirsutism, acne, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and virilization. This syndrome is different from the type B that has been demonstrated to be secondary to the presence of circulating autoantibodies against the insulin receptor.","Insulin dependent diabetes;Cancer;Non-insulin dependent diabetes;Infection;Parkinsons disease;Hypertension;Diabetes mellitus;Hyperinsulinemia

This is a form of non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of Dacie type 1. After splenectomy, which has little benefit, basophilic inclusions called Heinz bodies are demonstrable in the erythrocytes. Before splenectomy, diffuse or punctate basophilia may be evident. Most of these cases are probably instances of hemoglobinopathy. The hemoglobin demonstrates heat lability. Heinz bodies are observed also with the Ivemark syndrome (asplenia with cardiovascular anomalies) and with glutathione peroxidase deficiency.;Defects in HBB are the cause of beta-thalassemia [MIM:141900, 604131]. The thalassemias are the most common monogenic diseases and occur mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of beta-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. Absence of beta chain causes beta(0)-thalassemia, while reduced amounts of detectable beta globin causes beta(+)-thalassemia. In the severe forms of beta-thalassemia, the excess alpha globin chains accumulate in the developing erythroid precursors in the marrow. Their deposition leads to a vast increase in erythroid apoptosis that in turn causes ineffective erythropoiesis and severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. Clinically, beta-thalassemia is divided into thalassemia major (transfusion dependent), thalassemia intermedia (of intermediate severity), and thalassemia minor (asymptomatic).;Defects in HBB are the cause of sickle cell anemia [MIM:603903]; also known as sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia is characterized by abnormally shaped red cells resulting in chronic anemia and periodic episodes of pain, serious infections and damage to vital organs. Normal red blood cells are round and flexible and flow easily through blood vessels, but in sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin (called Hb S) causes red blood cells to become stiff. They are C-shaped and resembles a sickle. These stiffer red blood cells can led to microvascular occlusion thus cutting off the blood supply to nearby tissues.;Defects in HBB are the cause of dominant beta-thalassemia inclusion body type [MIM:603902]. This form of beta-thalassemia is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and is characterized by anemia, enlargement of the spleen, and gross abnormalities of the erythrocytes and their precursors.","NONE

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by control,"TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers.;Defects in TP53 are involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [MIM:133239]. ESCC is a tumor of the esophagus.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]. LFS is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.;Defects in TP53 may be associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma [MIM:161550]; also known as nasopharyngeal cancer.;Defects in TP53 are found in Barrett metaplasia; also known as Barrett esophagus. It is a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.;Defects in TP53 are involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) [MIM:275355].;Defects in TP53 are involved in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Cigarette smoke is a prime mutagenic agent in cancer of the aerodigestive tract.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of lung cancer [MIM:211980].;Defects in TP53 are a cause of choroid plexus papilloma [MIM:260500]. Choroid plexus papilloma is a slow-growing benign tumor of the choroid plexus that often invades the leptomeninges. In children it is usually in a lateral ventricle but in adults it is more often in the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus is common, either from obstruction or from tumor secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. If it undergoes malignant transformation it is called a choroid plexus carcinoma. Primary choroid plexus tumors are rare and usually occur in early childhood.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of one form of hereditary adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC) [MIM:202300]. ADCC is a rare childhood tumor, representing about 0.4% of childhood tumors, with a high incidence of associated tumors. ADCC occurs with increased frequency in patients with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [MIM:130650] and is a component tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome [MIM:151623].","NONE

XLA is a humoral immunodeficiency disease which results in developmental defects in the maturation pathway of B-cells. Affected boys have normal levels of pre-B-cells in their bone marrow but virtually no circulating mature B-lymphocytes. This results in a lack of immunoglobulins of all classes and leads to recurrent bacterial infections like otitis, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, sinusitis in the first few years of life, or even some patients present overwhelming sepsis or meningitis, resulting in death in a few hours. Treatment in most cases is by infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin.;Defects in BTK may be the cause of X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia and isolated growth hormone deficiency (XLA- IGHD) [MIM:307200]; also known as agammaglobulinemia and isolated growth hormone deficiency or Fleisher syndrome or isolated growth hormone deficiency type 3 (IGHD3).

Two receptors bind one interferon gamma dimer.,"Defects in IFNGR1 are a cause of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) [MIM:209950]; also known as familial disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection. This rare condition confers predisposition to illness caused by moderately virulent mycobacterial species, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and by the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. The pathogenic mechanism underlying MSMD is the impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity whose severity determines the clinical outcome. Some patients die of overwhelming mycobacterial disease with lepromatous-like lesions in early childhood, whereas others develop, later in life, disseminated but curable infections with tuberculoid granulomas. MSMD is a genetically heterogeneous disease with autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked inheritance.","NONE

MODY [MIM:606391] is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes mellitus. The pancreas serves both endocrine and exocrine functions. The endocrine cells are found in the islets of Langerhans. They synthesize insulin and other hormones, and are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The exocrine cells produce bicarbonate and digestive enzymes and are involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic malabsorption. The localization of the islets within exocrine pancreatic tissue is suggestive of an interdependency and cross-talk between these two cell populations in their normal and in their abnormal function.","Hyperlipidemia;Hypercholesterolemia

This autosomal recessive disorder is the most common inherited disease of platelets. GT is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding of mild-to-moderate severity and the inability of this integrin to recognize macromolecular or synthetic peptide ligands. GT has been classified clinically into types I and II. In type I, platelets show absence of the glycoprotein IIb/beta-3 complexes at their surface and lack fibrinogen and clot retraction capability. In type II, the platelets express the glycoprotein IIb/beta-3 complex at reduced levels (5-20% controls), have detectable amounts of fibrinogen, and have low or moderate clot retraction capability. The platelets of GT variants have normal or near normal (60-100%) expression of dysfunctional receptors.","NONE
